### Description of Adaptive Randomization Algorithm

This code is an implementation of an adaptive randomization algorithm in R. The algorithm assigns patients to either a control or 
experimental group based on the smaller marginal sum of the variables of interest (blood pressure and sex) in the previously assigned patients. 
The code also adds random columns for generalization and ensures reproducibility by setting the seed. The output of the code is a table that

group based on the smaller marginal sum of the variables of interest (blood pressure and sex) in the previously assigned patients. The code also
adds random columns for generalization and ensures reproducibility by setting the seed. The output of the code is a table that displays the number 
of patients assigned to each group and the final marginal table that shows the number of patients with low, medium, and high blood pressure and the 
number of male and female patients in each group. The code ends with a task for counting the levels of each factor, which is left for the next day. 
Finally, the assigned groups are written to a CSV file named "adapt_assignments.csv"
